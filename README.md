# Welcome to my github
Hi, and welcome to my Github
For the moment I might not have that much free code published here.
As most of my code was written as developer was licensed, so I cannot publish a lot.

# GekkoStrategies
Custom strategies for the trading application Gekko.
You'll notice a lot of strategies here, they're not a run and make big profit.
Although i only submitted code if is the gain was 20% above market (in gekko test runs).
20% and higher is allready pretty good (your bank doesnt do that).
However it depends a lot on crypto coin choise, and the fine tuning of the toml file.


# Side notes
- For spam reasons, I've disabled my email address here.
  So you will have to raise an issue on github to discuss my code, which I don't mind.
  I gladly discuss the code.
- As for Gekko, i was fairly new to writing javascript i'm more used to C# C++ Python etc, javascript is new to me.
  So if you think it can be coded better just raise issue and explain how.
  Overall i think the code is a lot better then most of the cryptoalgo's i've seen.
  At least i explain what i do 
  Despite understanding my trading math might be too complex for a lot of people, including sometimes myself ;) 
  Well who care the complexity of math these days
-In general the math works well with the right toml settings if you got better ones let me know (thats your part of this free code deal).

# Interest
My interest is on Neural network based trading, though despite having seen many claims of gekko algo's to do that.
I so far found no real good implementation... if i ever get the time for it... i love to see something in tensorflow.
I know tensorflow under javascript is possible.. but have not seen any gekko algo.
I think it would be a huge trading braketrough if one can get it to work with gekko.
(just imagine trading on your favorite jupyter notebook, then use that trained network inside gekko..super cool).
